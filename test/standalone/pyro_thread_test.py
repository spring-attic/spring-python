# This is a stand-alone test, meaning it doesn't run well in automated
# scenarios. This script exposed bug https://jira.springframework.org/browse/SESPRINGPYTHONPY-99,
# which showed _PyroThread having a name collisions with python2.6's threading.Thread
# class. By renaming _PyroThread's self.daemon as self.pyro_daemon, this code
# now works with python2.6. It was also used to confirm python2.5, and jython2.5.1.FINAL.
