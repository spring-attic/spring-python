    ObjectContainer is a container which uses multiple Config objects to read sources of
    object definitions. When a object is requested from this container, it may optionally
    pull the object from a scoped cache. If there is no stored copy of the object, it
    uses the scanned definition and its associated ObjectFactory to create an instance. It
    can then optionally store it in a scoped cache for future usage (e.g. singleton).
    
    Object definitions are stored in the container in a neutral format, decoupling the
    container entirely from the original source location. This means that XML, python code,
    and other formats may all contain definitions. By the time they
    reach this container, it doesn't matter what their original format was when a object
    instance is needed. NOTE: This explicitly means that one object in one source
    can refer to another object in another source OF ANY FORMAT as a property.
