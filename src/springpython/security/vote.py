    are different categories of ConfigAttributes used, this will not be optimal since the voter
    will be voting for attributes which do not represent roles. However, this option may be of
    some use when using preexisting role names without a prefix, and no ability exists to prefix
    them with a role prefix on reading them in, such as provided for example in JdbcDaoImpl.
